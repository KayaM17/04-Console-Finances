# Console Finances

Welcome to my console finances application! I'm excited to share how I built this tool to help manage personal finances directly from the command line.

## Introduction

In this project, I developed a console-based application for managing personal finances. As someone passionate about financial literacy and technology, I wanted to create a simple yet powerful tool to help users track their expenses, monitor their budgets, and gain better insights into their financial health.

## Instructions



* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`)

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis 
  ----------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average Change: -2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

Your final code should print the analysis to the console.

**Hints:**

* You will need to do some research on your own for this project!

* Remember, in order to combine strings and variables in the console you will need to use **concatenation**.

* How do you only print to the nearest 100th in JavaScript?
